# Create Action Lab

## Objectives

1. Build a working create action
2. Use form_tag to create a new form that submits to action
3. Correctly name form fields so that they end up in params on the top level
4. Assign data from params to an instance in create
5. Save an instance in a controller action
6. Redirect_to from a controller action to a show page
7. Use a named route for the new page and put it on the index page

## Notes
